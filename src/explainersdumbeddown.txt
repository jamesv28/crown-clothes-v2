Reducers - patttern for state management
In order to change the cart reducer we call an action
action is just an object that takes two parameters: 
{
    type: string,
    payload: anything at all (optional)
}

In the reducer, we pass two parameters:
state: which refers to the current state of the reducer,
action: 

In the reducer, always spread the initial state, and then all of the values you wish to change
return {
    ...state,
    currentUser: payload
}
